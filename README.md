# Homebridge Apple TV

This is a Homebridge plugin that exposes Apple TVs to HomeKit, noteably the power state as a switch and optionally the device state (playing, paused, etc.) as motion sensors.

## Installation

To make this plugin work you need to install [PyATV](https://pypi.org/project/pyatv/). To ensure you did it right run
```
atvremote --version
```

## Configuration
Configuration can be done using [Homebridge Config UI X](https://github.com/oznu/homebridge-config-ui-x).

## Sample Configuration

```yaml
{
    "platform": "AppleTV",
    "devices": [

            "airplayCredentials": "...",
